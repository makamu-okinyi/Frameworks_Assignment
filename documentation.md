CORD-19 Data Analysis Project Report

Project Overview:
This project analyzes the CORD-19 dataset metadata to understand patterns in COVID-19 research publications. The analysis includes data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and an interactive Streamlit application.

Key Findings:

Temporal Patterns: COVID-19 publications show a significant increase starting in 2020, with peaks during pandemic waves.

Journal Distribution: A small number of journals publish the majority of COVID-19 research, with medical and virology journals being most prominent.

Common Themes: Title analysis reveals frequent terms like "covid", "sars", "pandemic", "clinical", and "study", indicating the focus areas of research.

Data Quality: The dataset has significant missing values in some columns (like abstract), but core metadata is largely complete.

Technical Implementation:

Used pandas for data manipulation and cleaning

Created multiple visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

Built an interactive web application with Streamlit

Implemented text analysis for title word frequency

Challenges Encountered:

Large Dataset Size: The metadata file is substantial, requiring efficient memory management

Missing Data: Many columns had significant missing values requiring careful handling

Date Format Inconsistencies: Publication dates had various formats needing standardization

Learning Outcomes:

Enhanced skills in data cleaning and preparation

Gained experience with Streamlit for building data applications

Improved understanding of temporal analysis in research data

Developed better practices for handling real-world, messy datasets

How to Run the Project
